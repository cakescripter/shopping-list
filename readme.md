## Shopping List Application

### Description

Simple shopping list application built with Vanilla JavaScript. It allows users to add, edit, and remove items from the shopping list, as well as filter the items based on a search query.
The code demonstrates the usage of event listeners, DOM manipulation, local storage, and various utility functions to manage the shopping list functionality. It provides a foundation for building a responsive and interactive list management application. Project was built as part of the Brad Traversy's course.
